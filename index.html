            I'm a business-minded engineering student with a passion for tech and social entrepreneurship. I 
            have applied that passion at UCLA by leading projects to lower UCLA's carbon footprint including 
            raising money for clean energy installments and advocating for reduced waste production. But this 
            past year, I've discovered the power of code and love it.
