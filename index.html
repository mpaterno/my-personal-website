            I'm a business-minded engineering student with a passion for tech and social entrepreneurship. 
            At UCLA, I've worked to lower UCLA's carbon footprint by raising money for clean energy installments 
            and advocating for reduced trash production. But this past year, I've discovered the power of code and
            love it.
